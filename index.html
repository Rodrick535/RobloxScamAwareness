<p>If you've been on roblox for a while, there's a good chance you've seen this:</p>

<p>And if you've clicked on the links, you probably ran into this:</p>

<p>If you don't know already, this is a completely scripted chatroom. I found conclusive proof of this in the website's code.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor, and ignore those spam comments that are ruining roblox for everyone, alright?</p>
